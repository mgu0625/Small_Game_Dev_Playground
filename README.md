### For Side Small Gaming Projects to Grow my Coding Skills (ãƒ»ãƒ»ã€‚)ã‚ž

This repository is a space where I experiment with game development as a side hobby, primarily using Python and Java. 

My goal is to improve my coding skills while exploring different aspects of game logic, optimization, and interactive design. Whether you're here out of curiosity, looking for inspiration, or just browsing, I hope you find something interesting!
